# üöÄ E-commerce Real-Time Order Processing

This project simulates an **e-commerce order processing system** using AWS services such as **Step Functions**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, and **API Gateway**. The system processes orders in real-time, from validation to storing the orders in DynamoDB and S3. It also detects high-value orders and triggers alerts via SNS. LocalStack is used to emulate AWS services locally.
